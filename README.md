FIML for Missing Data in Lavaan
========================================================

The purpose of this repository is to take some of the examples related to full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation on the Applied Missing Data [website] [1], and translate them into `lavaan’. The code on the website in mostly for Mplus, which is quite expensive. I hope this will give those who don’t have access to Mplus the ability to work through the examples using free and open source software.
